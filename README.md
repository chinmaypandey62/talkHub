talkHub is an AI-powered voice assistant that allows users to interact with the application using voice commands and receive spoken responses. This project leverages OpenAI's API for natural language processing and conversation generation, making it a powerful and versatile voice assistant.

## Features

- **Voice Input**: Users can speak to the AI assistant, and it will process their voice commands.
- **Text-to-Speech**: talkHub converts generated responses into spoken words, providing a seamless user experience.
- **Natural Language Processing**: Utilizes OpenAI's API to understand and generate human-like responses.
- **Web-based Interface**: Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the frontend provides an intuitive and user-friendly interface.
- **Backend**: The server-side is powered by Python and Django, handling user requests and communication with OpenAI.
- **User Authentication**: Secure user authentication ensures data privacy and personalization.
- **Conversation History**: Users can view and manage their conversation history.
- **Responsive Design**: The frontend is designed to work seamlessly across various devices and screen sizes.
